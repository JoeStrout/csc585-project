# Joe Strout's CSC585 Project

This is the code repository for Joe Strout's 2018 class project for CSC 585, Algorithms for Natural Language Processing, at [University of Arizona](http://www.arizona.edu). This repository contains:

+ A C implementation of word2vec, forked from https://github.com/dav/word2vec
+ Custom code to output particular sets of embedded word vectors for further analysis.

# Installation

The following instructions assume a recent macOS environment with gcc and make (obtained, for example, by installing the Xcode command-line tools).  Other Unix/Linux environments should work similarly.

1. Download the project from https://github.com/JoeStrout/csc585-project
2. At a shell prompt, cd to the `src` directory:
```bash
cd trunk/src
```
3. Build the executables with `make`:
```
make
```
4. Enjoy.
